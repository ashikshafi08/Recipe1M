# Recipe Generator 


## Note:


**This project has been halted for a month or so till I am preparing for my IELTS and university exams. Not letting down this project halfway, will be working once I get done with other stuffs. Remember one at a time.**

**SideNote** : Will be spending 1 or 2 hours (hopefully not sure) on this everyday. But not sure whether to stick with 42 days challenge (might go beyond that). 

Its my first time taking up such a big project, where I have to do almost everything from scratch. Get the dataset, clean it, make it appropriate for my model, train , optimize it and the last part where things get interesting that is deploying this model on production. Last year I promised myself I will work on a Startup idea but it doesn't matter how well it goes, all I wanted to do is try and see how things turn out.

### Whats the goal?

Given a food/dish image my model has to generate some recipes along with some instructions on how to cook that particular dish. Thats should be the ideal outcome but I also have plans of deploying it or maybe make a discord bot with a Data Flywheel. This is more of MLoPs and since I have 0 knowledge about it, I have to dedicate some time and see how can I do it. 

Implementing research papers is something I wanna do in my daily basis and thats what ML Engineers has to do. Convert the paper with math into useful code that can help people to fulfil their needs.

## About the Paper

**Generates cooking recipe for a given food image. It will get us the title , ingredients and cooking instruction directly from an image.**

- They have used an inverse cooking system approach, where you can input either an image or  recipe and it gives us the corresponding recipes and images respectively depending upon their task.
- But we are going to take image as an input and generate recipes for it.
